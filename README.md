## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI Analysis Not Working**
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check your OpenAI account has available credits
- Ensure you have internet connection

**Gmail Integration Issues**
- **Error 400: invalid_request**: Make sure you're accessing via `http://localhost:8080` (not `file://`)
- Check that `http://localhost:8080` is in your OAuth authorized JavaScript origins
- Verify redirect URI is exactly: `http://localhost:8080/job_tracker_app.html`
- See [README_SETUP.md](README_SETUP.md) for detailed Gmail setup instructions

**Jobs Not Saving**
- Data is auto-saved every 30 seconds - changes should persist automatically
- Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Ensure you're not in private/incognito mode (localStorage is disabled)
- Try exporting a backup and refreshing the page
- Check browser console for error messages

**Data Recovery**
- The app automatically creates backups - if data is lost, try refreshing the page
- Use "Export Backup" in Configuration Setup to manually save your data
- Use "Import Backup" to restore from a previously exported file

**App Won't Start**
- Make sure Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
- Make script executable: `chmod +x start_job_tracker.sh`
- Try running manually: `python3 start_server.py`

**Port 8080 Already in Use**
- Edit `start_server.py` and change `PORT = 8080` to another number (e.g., 8081)
- Update any bookmarks and OAuth settings with the new port number

**Export Not Working**
- Make sure pop-ups are allowed for the page
- Try a different browser
- Check that downloads are enabled

**Performance Issues**
- Clear old job entries you no longer need
- Use filters to reduce displayed jobs
- Try refreshing the browser
